        My name is Vithório da Cunha Marques. I am a brazilian Computer Science student
        at Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC). Logical thinking and problem solving have always
        interested me so, following my elder brother's advice, I started programming and never
        stopped since them. My goal is to become a great IT professional and travel around the world
        programming and visiting the most awesome places.
